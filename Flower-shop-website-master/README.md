# Flower-shop-website
This was part of web designing assignment.
<br>I'm not very good at designing still I like this website.So I'm sharing it with you.
<br> For basic structure, We used templates. I didn't remember original. but we done many changes.
<br> For Flower rainig effect we used [Particle.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).
<br> For raining effect you have to update absolute path of image url in (flowershop/js/app.js).
